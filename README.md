## 🛠️ For The Nerdy Folks

This app is powered by:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind for that sleek look), and JavaScript (for the magic)
- **Backend**: Python with Flask (because we're fancy like that)
- **Data Source**: Recreation.gov API (our inside connection to the National Park Service)

## 🚀 Get It Running

```bash
# Clone this treasure map
git clone https://github.com/ageem/yosemite-campsite-availability.git

# Install the magic spells
pip install flask requests

python server.py

```

## 🌟 Why We Made This

Because we love camping, hate refreshing Recreation.gov every 5 minutes, and believe technology should make outdoor adventures more accessible!
